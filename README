Post Hookie lets you skip out on having to create a public-facing server to test HTTP POST hooks from 3rd party services.

Want to develop a github post-receive hook, but don't have hosting yet? play PostHookie!

1. in the weebhook section, point the post-receive hook URL to post-hookie.heroku.com/hook/a_fancy_name
2. go to post-hookie.heroku.com/hook/a_fancy_name
3. see the raw form data, and have a pre-formated curl command to test it locally!
